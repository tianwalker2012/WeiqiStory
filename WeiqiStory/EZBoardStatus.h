//Honestly, I get lost just now. 
//Let me find my sense back. 
//1. Who is the caller?
//2. What's the expectation of the caller?
//Currently I have 2 qi detection needs.
//a. I want to put a button on a place, I need to know if I put my button on that place
//Do I still have qi?(If I don't have Qi, then will check for sub cases, if the opponent will be killed?
//b. If I can put the button, I need to check do I get anybody killed
// I need to check all the people around me, see if they still have qi or not.
// (If not will remove them.)
// Consider case1, if I put a button down, what should I do?
// For each button near me, I will ask them to check qi.
// If I am white button, I will check for black qi.
// If it is space return 1, if it is white return 0, if it is black, if will return the the space count + plus the qi of it's neigbour. 
// I would like to return a ArrayList have zero qi, 
// I will detect for black button.
// Good.
// Actually, I have 2 needs one is to get the exact number of QI, one is that stop by finding any QI.
// I guess, I am interested in the later one.

//Return the total removed button count
//Will remove black

//What's the purpose of this functionality?

//It will check if anybody will get removed

//Returned value will be all removed buttons

//What's the purpose of this method.
//Who will call this method?
//Before plant a button, this method will be called

//If 1. We have availableQi
//Or 2. We can eat opponents
//Don't worry about robbery.
//Robbery check have done before calling this.
//I am imagine just plant this and check if we have Qi.
//Or if we can remove any thing.
//Cool.
//If we remove the side effect checkAndRemove we are perfect.
