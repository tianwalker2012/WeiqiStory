//Why do I pick a ugly name like this?
//Because I used Button as the name for qi zi. 
//Time to correct this error, right. 
//Or it will make things worser in the future. 
//Fix it now. 
//Initially, I think layer could help me achieve this.
//Then It turns out, Region could not. 
//What I need actually is the a responsive region.
//Then I could put a button, or a chess board or other things
//I use targeted touch delegate because this could simplify the mutliple touch process. 
//What if I want process multiple touch?
//Let's address this later. 
//Collect the low hanging fruit first.
